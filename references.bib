  abstract = {Assuming the validity of grand canonical statistics, we study Bose-Einstein condensation of relatively small numbers of particles confined by a harmonic potential. Corrections to the case of large particle numbers appear as a downward shift of the condensation temperature TC and an enhancement of the specific heat capacity below TC. Even if the particle number is merely of order 104, the specific heat capacity exhibits a sharp drop at the onset of condensation, reminiscent of the heat capacity of liquid 4He at the λ-point.}

  abstract = {Using the Euler-Maclaurin summation we calculate analytically the internal energy for non-interacting bosons confined within a harmonic oscillator potential. The specific heat shows a sharp λ-like peak indicating a condensation into the ground state at a well-defined transition temperature. Full agreement is obtained with direct numerical calculation of the same quantities. When the number of trapped particles is very large and at temperatures near and above the transition temperature, the results also agree with previous approximate calculations. At extremely low temperatures both the specific heat and the number of particles excited from the condensate are exponentially suppressed.}
